This project is about building drones. There is a lot of interest in drones these days, and a variety of industries have been impacted by improvements in drone technology and reductions in cost. If one simply wanted to have a drone, there are options on Amazon for under $50. However, that is not the purpose of this project. The purpose of this project is primarily pedagogical. I am undertaking this project as a means to teach myself how drones work. For the purposes of this project, I will try to minimize the amount of tutorial-style resources used. Of course, at some point, the limits of my existing knowledge will be reached and I will have to look to outside resources for help. To the extent possible, I will try to use outside resources that maximize learning.
